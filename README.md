# _Coot_ (Crystallographic Object-Oriented Toolkit)
_Coot_ is a powerful macromolecular model-building tool for analysing X-ray data and models (i.e. proteins, ligands, RNA and DNA). 

There are many tools for model manipulation and building, such as minimization, molecular superposition, fragment rotation/translations, rotamer-fitting, de novo building and refinement.

_Coot_ is used by scientists using X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM for analysis of proteins, electron density maps, protein interactions and drug design.

This repo hosts the flatpak wrapper for [_Coot_](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/), available at [Flathub](https://flathub.org/ja/apps/io.github.pemsley.coot).

_Coot_ is under active development at the [upstream repo](https://github.com/pemsley/coot) by Paul Emsley.

## Installation

```shell
flatpak install flathub io.github.pemsley.coot
flatpak run io.github.pemsley.coot
```
